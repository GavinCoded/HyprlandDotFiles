# hyprland dotfiles

this is my hyprland setup based on omarchy and livakivi's configs at https://github.com/livakivi/config-files/tree/main/linux/.config

it uses omarchy for theming, including theme switching and hooks for color changes across applications. you need the theme switcher script and hooks from omarchy they are in the omarchy directory here, but refer to the original repository for any modifications.

the bar is waybar.

to use it, copy these files into your ~/.config folder (back up your existing files first please!). place the hypr folder into ~/.config/hypr, and do the same for waybar, mako, and others. ensure you have hyprland, waybar, mako, and swayosd installed if on arch or similar.

adjust the configuration files as needed, such as monitors.conf for your screens.


i used normal arch for this setup and not omarchy i just copied the files from omarchy into my arch install. i recommend you do the same if you want to use everything here as is. personally i only really care about the waybar part but the rest is included anyway.

that's it.
